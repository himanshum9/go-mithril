# Architecture of the Multi-Tenant Location Streaming System

## Overview
The Multi-Tenant Location Streaming System is designed to allow multiple tenants to submit and manage their location data securely and efficiently. The architecture is built using a microservice approach, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and isolation of tenant data.

## Microservices
The system consists of the following microservices:

1. **Auth Service**
   - Responsible for user authentication and authorization.
   - Utilizes AWS Cognito for managing user identities and JWT token generation.
   - Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate between tenant users and admin users.

2. **Tenant Service**
   - Manages tenant information, including creation, retrieval, and updates.
   - Ensures that each tenant's data is isolated using a shared schema with a tenant identifier.

3. **Location Service**
   - Handles the submission of location data from tenant users.
   - Processes and stores location data in a PostgreSQL database.
   - Streams location data to a third-party application in real-time.

4. **Streaming Service**
   - Manages the streaming of location data to external systems.
   - Implements error handling and reconnection logic to ensure reliable data transmission.

## Data Flow
1. **User Authentication**
   - Users authenticate via the Auth Service using AWS Cognito.
   - Upon successful authentication, a JWT token is issued.

2. **Location Data Submission**
   - Authenticated users submit their geographical location (latitude and longitude) to the Location Service at regular intervals.
   - The Location Service stores the data in the PostgreSQL database, tagged with the corresponding tenant ID.

3. **Data Streaming**
   - The Location Service processes the stored location data and streams it to the Streaming Service.
   - The Streaming Service sends the data to a third-party application using a suitable protocol (e.g., HTTP, WebSockets).

## Database Design
- The PostgreSQL database uses a shared schema with a tenant identifier (TenantID) to ensure data isolation.
- Each service has its own set of models to interact with the database, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

## Scalability
- The microservice architecture allows for independent scaling of each service based on demand.
- The use of AWS services (like Cognito and RDS) provides built-in scalability and reliability.

## Conclusion
This architecture provides a robust framework for managing multi-tenant location data, ensuring security, scalability, and efficient data processing. Each component is designed to work seamlessly together while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities.
